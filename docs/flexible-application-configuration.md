## Configuring Importance

Your app should get its settings from different places and work smoothly whether it's on your laptop or in production. This is really important for things to run well in container setups.

We're loosely following the [12-factor app configuration guidelines](https://12factor.net/config) that emphasize storing config in the environment and separating it from code.

## The Three Ways Apps Should Get Their Config

---

Your application should support all three of these configuration methods, because different situations call for different approaches:

### 1. Environment Variables

This is your bread and butter for containerized apps. Environment variables are:

- **Perfect for Docker/Kubernetes** – Easy to inject at runtime
- **Great for secrets** – Can be populated from secret stores
- **Cloud-native friendly** – Every orchestration platform handles them well

### 2. Configuration Files

Config files are great for complex setups and local development:

- **Better for complex config** – Nested structures, arrays, etc.
- **Version controllable** – Can be checked in for defaults
- **Human readable** – Easy to understand and modify

### 3. Command Line Flags

Command line flags are perfect for overrides and debugging:

- **Great for overrides** – Quick changes without rebuilding
- **Perfect for debugging** – Temporary config changes
- **Explicit and visible** – Easy to see what's different

## Configuration Precedence (Most Important Wins)

---

When your app starts up, it should check for configuration in this order. **Later sources override earlier ones**:

1. **Built-in defaults** – Safe values for development and testing
2. **Configuration files** – More complex structured config
3. **Environment variables** – Container-friendly overrides
4. **Command line flags** – Explicit overrides and debugging

**Important:** Your built-in defaults should _never_ be production-ready values. They should be obviously development values that would fail safely in production (like `localhost` database URLs).

## Docker & Kubernetes Best Practices

---

### For Docker Containers

- **Use environment variables** for most runtime config
- **Bake default config files** into your container image
- **Mount custom config files** as volumes when needed
- **Don't hardcode anything** that might change between environments

### For Kubernetes Deployments

- **ConfigMaps** for non-sensitive configuration data
- **Secrets** for sensitive data like passwords and API keys
- **Environment variables** to expose ConfigMap and Secret values
- **Init containers** for complex configuration setup if needed

### Handling Sensitive Configuration

Never, ever put secrets in your code or regular config files. Here's how to handle sensitive data properly:

#### What Counts as Sensitive?

- Database passwords and connection strings
- API keys and access tokens
- Encryption keys and certificates
- Third-party service credentials

#### How to Handle Secrets

- **Use a secrets management service** (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- **Kubernetes Secrets** for container deployments
- **Environment variables** populated at runtime from secure sources
- **Never log sensitive values** – redact them in logs and error messages

### Configuration Validation

Your app should validate its configuration at startup and fail fast if something's wrong:

- **Check required values** are present
- **Validate formats** (URLs, ports, timeouts, etc.)
- **Test connections** where possible (database, external APIs)
- **Provide clear error messages** when validation fails
