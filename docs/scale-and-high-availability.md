## Our guide to scale & high availability

---

We've all been there—your service suddenly gets super popular, traffic jumps 10 times, and everything feels like chaos. The good news? If you plan smart now, you can avoid those stressful nights later. Make your services stateless by default. Think of them like restaurant servers who can serve any table without remembering past orders. The kitchen—your database—takes care of all the memory.

> **The Golden Rule**

> Plan for 10x growth from the start. It's way easier to build things right from the beginning than to fix them when traffic is already heavy.

## Building in Redundancy

---

Let's be honest - things _will_ break. Servers crash, networks hiccup, and that one Azure region you depend on will have an outage right before a big launch. The question isn't _if_ something will fail, but _when_ - and whether you'll be ready.

### Avoiding the Dreaded Single Point of Failure

Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) are like having only one key to your house - lose it, and you're locked out. Here's how to avoid them:

- Make services stateless: Remember that restaurant server analogy? Stateless services are like having multiple servers who can all handle any customer. If one calls in sick, the others keep the restaurant running smoothly.
- Think like a backup generator: You want multiple ways to keep the lights on.

### Geographic Redundancy: Your Insurance Policy

Geographic redundancy is like having backup offices in different cities. If there's a natural disaster, power outage, or that infamous "someone with a backhoe cut the fiber cable" incident, your other locations keep things running.

Reality check: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Start small, but design with geo-redundancy in mind from the beginning.

### When You Can't Avoid State: Database Strategies

Some services _need_ to remember things (looking at you, databases). For these stateful services, you'll need a game plan:

- Replication: Keep copies of your data in multiple places
- Sharding: Split your data across multiple databases
- Plan for failures: What happens when one of your database servers decides to take an unscheduled nap?

### Load Balancing: Your Traffic Director

Having multiple service instances is great, but useless if traffic keeps hitting the one that's already overwhelmed. Load balancers are like smart traffic controllers - they direct requests to healthy services that can actually handle them.

## Scaling Horizontally Like a Pro

The beautiful thing about well-designed stateless services? You can just add more of them. It's like having a food truck business - need to serve more customers? Add more trucks!

### Health Checks Are Your Best Friend

Your orchestration system (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.) needs to know when to spin up new instances and when to shut down the broken ones. This requires:

- Proper health endpoints: Simple `/ops/heartbeat` checks that actually mean something
- Meaningful metrics: requests per second, response time, error rates, CPU usage, memory,
- Automated responses: Let the system make decisions faster than any human could

### The Testing Reality Check

> **An Uncomfortable Truth**
>
> If you haven't load tested your auto-scaling, it doesn't work. Period.

Proper load testing is essential to ensure that your auto-scaling mechanisms can handle real-world traffic spikes and demands effectively.

Set up automated load tests - Test your scaling triggers regularly - Monitor how quickly new instances come online - Practice failure scenarios (chaos engineering, anyone?)

### Quick Wins for Horizontal Scaling

1. Containerize everything - Makes deployment consistent and fast
2. Monitor everything - You can't fix what you can't see
3. Practice scaling down - Don't just test scaling up!

## The Magic of Caching

---

> **Before we talk caching**
>
> Consider how your service is being used. If it gets only a few hundred calls a day, it's not a heavily used application. Don't set up caching infrastructure unless the juice is worth the squeeze. It add complexity to the overall system. And remember that added infrastructure will require monitoring and alerting like everything else!

> Now, with that said…

Picture this: You're at a coffee shop, and every time someone orders a latte, the barista has to call the supplier, order beans, wait for delivery, roast them, grind them, and then make your drink. Sounds ridiculous, right? That's your system without caching.

### The Caching Mindset Shift

**The old way**: Every request hits your database/API
**The smart way**: Frequently requested data gets stored closer to where it's needed

### Strategy: Separate the Common from the Unique

This is where caching gets interesting. Instead of caching entire responses, think about what parts are shared vs. unique:

- **Common data**: User preferences, configuration settings, frequently accessed content
- **Unique data**: Personal messages, real-time status updates, user-specific calculations

**Pro tip**: Cache the common stuff aggressively, let the unique stuff flow through fresh.

### Caching Action Plan

**Quick wins:**

- [ ] Add caching headers to your API responses
- [ ] Set up Redis for session data
- [ ] Cache database queries that don't change often

**Level up moves:**

- [ ] Implement cache warming strategies
- [ ] Set up cache invalidation patterns
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates
- [ ] Plan for cache failures (yes, caches can go down too!)
